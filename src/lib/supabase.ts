Your body's ready for motion, but there's no clear outlet. This is sympathetic overdrive - your system saying, 'Move me.'",
    defaultActions: [
      'Cardio release (2-5 min): Do jumping jacks, jog in place, or run a short burst down the hall. Burn off adrenaline before you try to think.',

    defaultActions: [
      'Tactile grounding: Put on socks and press your feet into something soft or textured. Feel the warmth, the weight, the pressure.',
      'Sequential motion cue: Lift your right leg, then your left, then your right again. The pattern matters - it restarts motor coordination.',

    defaultActions: [
      "Cognitive unload: Write every unfinished task somewhere - don't organize, just externalize. ADHD research shows 'brain dumps' restore executive bandwidth.",
      '5-4-3-2-1 grounding: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.',

    description: "Your brain is caught replaying - that mistake, that message, that imagined scenario. The loop tightens each time you revisit it. You know you're spiraling, but you can't redirect. This is a hyperfocus trap mixed with emotional replay - your reward system locked on unresolved stress.",
    defaultActions: [
      'Verbal release: Speak your thoughts out loud or record a quick voice note - externalizing them reduces cognitive load.',
      "Expressive writing: Write nonstop for 3 minutes. End with: 'This thought is out of my head and onto the page.'",
      'Soothing touch: Rub slow circles over your chest and heart while exhaling fully. Self-touch here lowers cortisol and signals safety.'

    description: "You're dimmed - scrolling, staring, zoned out. Time blurs, sound dulls. It's the ADHD shutdown: the nervous system pulling back after too much input. You're not broken; you're buffering.",
    defaultActions: [
      'Rhythmic sensory input: Put on music with a steady beat and sway or tap along - vestibular input reawakens body awareness.',
      'Tactile grounding: Rub your arms, trace your fingers over fabric, feel texture come back to life.',
      "Orienting practice: Look around and softly name what's real - 'That's my desk. That's my plant. It's green. It's raining.' This pulls you back into the now."
